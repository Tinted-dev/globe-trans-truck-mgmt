# **Fleet Management System - Backend**

The Fleet Management System is a **full-stack application** designed to manage drivers, trucks, assignments, and users. This repository contains the **backend** built with **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**. The backend provides a RESTful API for the frontend (built with React) to interact with the database.

## **Seeding the Database**
To populate the database with fake data for testing, run:
```bash
python seed.py
```
This script uses the **Faker** library to generate realistic data for drivers, trucks, assignments, and users.

---

## **Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///fleet_management.db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Usage
### Running the Application
- Open `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser.
- Register/Login as a user.
- Admins has full control of the application , while fleet Managers can view assignments.

## **Future Improvements**
- Add real-time tracking of truck locations using a map API.
- Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates.
- Add advanced reporting features for driver performance and truck utilization.
